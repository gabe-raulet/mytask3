Given: set of nodes ina  loop

* compute reaching definitions
* compute loop invariant computation
* compute dominators
* find the exits of the loop (i.e. nodes with successor outside loop)
* candidate statement for code motion:
    * loop invariant
    * in blocks that dominate all the exits of the loop
    * assign to variable not assigned to elsewhere in the loop
    * in blocks that dominate all blocks in that loop that use the variable assigned
* Perform a depth first search of the blocks
    * move the candidate to the preheader if all the invariant
      operations it depends upon have been moved
